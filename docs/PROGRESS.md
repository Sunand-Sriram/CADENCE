# Progress

## 2026-10-31 — Step 1 — Scaffold

- Created the CRS project directories, environment templates, dependency list,
  worker/reset scripts, README, and progress log without modifying `crs_core`.
- Configured mock mode and the requested local Redis, target, crash, evidence,
  and mock paths.
- Verify result: `.venv/bin/python` reports Python 3.11.18, but `python -c
  "import crs_core"` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError` because this checkout does
  not contain the pre-existing `crs_core/` package.
